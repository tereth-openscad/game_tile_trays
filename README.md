OpenSCAD tile storage trays for chipboard tokens/tiles.

Summary:

Card box for the mini cards which come with Mansions of Madness.

The following boxes were designed with the following in mind.

- Core box
- Beyond the Threshold
- Streets of Arkham
- Sanctum of Twilight
- Horrific Journeys

There are somewhat limited lid options right now. I'll update soon with more options.

2x mansions_card_lid_seal_v7
1x mansions_tile_features_tray_and_lid_v16


Print Settings:
The card box lid is the only thing that should have supports just for under the seal bit (it will get covered up by the seal so the quality doesn't matter that much).

The seal can be printed in two colors making the Cthulhu symbol one color and the rest of the seal another.  (I chose silver for the seal back and purple/blue for the Cthulhu.)


Post-Printing:

Post printing the tile tray is designed to hold 2 - 5mm x 1mm magnets (I used these: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07K6GBB46).  I just glued them in with E6000.



Design:
Designed using OpenSCAD - SCAD files will be posted after a bit of cleanup.
