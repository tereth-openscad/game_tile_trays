This is a customizable deck holder. It can be configured to allow vertical insert of the cards or to hold a horizontal (flat) deck. This was originally designed for the card game Hero Realms but could be used for other similar games or just as general purpose card holders.

For STLs/etc see thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4458380.

General features:
-------------------------
* Card size customizable
* Hex wall/base pattern to reduce filament used

TODO:
--------------------------
* As of now, the lids don't have a friction fit, but this could be achieved by tweaking the tolerance values for your specific printer.
* Add presets for different card sizes (including STLs)
* Add more STLs for sleeved/unsleeved cards
